### Review

I've come a long way from being a junior (at this category) to being an advanced in terms of communication - now I can take feedback, give quality guidance to other devs, and act on feedback quickly and effectively.

### Short Answer

I have demonstrated an ability to accept constructive feedback well, provide guidance to juniors, implement feedback quickly, and identify missing requirements in code. Additionally, I have proactively introduced new standards to improve project efficiency and have received positive feedback on my code quality and documentation.

### Long Answer

I have been actively collaborating with my colleagues, such as working closely with Sangita on the topicals module. I have been reviewing her PRs and mine before submitting them for a final review, which has helped me refine my code review skills and provide guidance to others.

I have improved my ability to identify missing requirements in the code before it reaches the QA stage. This not only saves time and resources but also demonstrates my increased understanding of the project requirements and attention to detail.

I have taken the initiative to introduce a new standard at the company that ensures all necessary information is gathered ahead of time to fix problems and better understand the domain. This proactive approach has led to increased efficiency and a more streamlined development process.

The feedback I have received on my PRs has been predominantly positive, with compliments on good design, coding choices, and documentation. While I still receive suggestions for minor improvements, I no longer receive feedback about bugs or missing requirements, which indicates growth in my technical abilities and understanding of project requirements.
