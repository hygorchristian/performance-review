### Review

I think I am in the Advaced level, transitioning to Expext, but I still didn't have opportunities to demonstrate that I can design critical-path features.

### Short Answer

Over the past months, I have progressed from intermediate to advanced by taking on more complex responsibilities, expanding my knowledge in software development practices and tools, enhancing code quality with fewer issues, and actively mentoring team members.

### Long Answer

I have taken on new responsibilities and focused on improving my skills in TypeScript, ensuring correct usage and increasing test coverage. Additionally, I've dedicated time to thoroughly understand the problems and requirements before working on solutions, which has led to better outcomes for the team.

I have expanded my knowledge of software development practices by learning about domain-driven design, CQRS, and event sourcing solutions like EventStore DB. I have also kept up with new TypeScript features and tools to improve my productivity.

I have actively participated in training courses to broaden my expertise, such as a course on dependency injection using inversion of control, and learning about AWS tools and Google Cloud Platform. These courses have allowed me to bring new ideas and solutions to the team.

Over the past six months, I have noticed a decrease in the amount of feedback regarding bugs or missing pieces in my code. Instead, I've been receiving more positive feedback, which is a testament to the improvement in my code quality.

I have contributed to the professional growth of our team by supporting and mentoring my colleague, Sangita, in understanding our system. This demonstrates my ability to share knowledge and work collaboratively, which is essential for a more advanced developer.
