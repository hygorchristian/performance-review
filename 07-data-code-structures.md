From `Junior` to `Advanced`

### Short Answer

Over the past few months, I've gone from being a Junior to almost an Advanced developer by taking charge of projects, fixing code issues, writing better docs, learning new skills, and really stepping up in my role, making a noticeable difference in our work and team progress.

### Long Answer

I have successfully completed significant parts of the Isolocity project, showcasing my ability to organize code, design data structures, and use collections efficiently. I have also been introduced to the Topicals project and am currently leading it, demonstrating my growth in taking responsibility and ownership of projects.

While working on the Medical Sales module, I have made improvements that showcase my ability to optimize code and identify performance issues. For example, I noticed a design issue with the retail package size and submitted a proposal to fix it. This is just one example among many where I have actively sought to improve the quality and performance of our codebase.

In recent months, I have put considerable effort into adding documentation and context to our codebase. This demonstrates my growing understanding of our projects and my ability to communicate that understanding effectively, making it easier for others to follow my work.

I have been proactive in my professional development, taking online courses and staying updated on new technologies and industry best practices by reading articles. This commitment to learning has helped me to improve my skills in data structures, algorithms, and design patterns.

My increased responsibility and ownership in the Topicals project highlight my growth as a developer. I have taken the lead in this project, which showcases my ability to handle complex tasks and make decisions that benefit the team and the project as a whole.
