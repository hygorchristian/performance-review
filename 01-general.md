### Review

I believe I have progressed from an intermediate transitioning to an advanced level, possibly at a solid level 4, due to my recent achievements and positive feedback.

### Short Answer

I have improved my domain understanding, refined my technical skills in TypeScript and testing, and enhanced our codebase quality. I've taken on mentorship roles, optimized workflows to save time, and received positive feedback from colleagues and customers alike. My dedication to learning and implementing new ideas also contributes to my growth as a developer.

### Long Answer

Improved understanding of the domain and project requirements: I learned from my experience on the isolocity project to better document and understand the domain before starting to code. In my recent project, I added value to the company by implementing new workflows that prevent building incorrect components from the outset.

Mentorship and leadership: I have taken on a mentorship role with Sangita, ensuring that requirements are clear and well-understood. I've been illustrating graphs, making annotations, reviewing her work, and managing project tasks. This demonstrates my ability to support and guide junior developers.

Skill improvement: I have improved my skills in TypeScript, testing, and code documentation, which have directly benefited my work and the company.

Problem-solving and workflow optimization: I successfully created a workflow that saves the company a significant amount of time by making us more precise in obtaining, documenting, and coding new requirements.

Codebase quality improvement: I have consistently improved the quality of the codebase by following good patterns in both backend and frontend development. Working independently on the frontend, I have dedicated substantial effort to enhance the UI and make our service appear more professional.

Positive feedback: I have received positive feedback from developer co-workers regarding the quality of my code, from QA staff about the usability of the system and my communication skills with non-technical staff, and from customers who appreciate the new features I've added to make the site easier to navigate.
