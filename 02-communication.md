### Review

Over the past months, my growth in communication, collaboration, domain understanding, project ownership, and adaptability has successfully transitioned me from an intermediate developer to a solid advanced developer.

### Short Answer

Over the past six months, I have improved my communication and prioritization, provided constructive feedback to peers, proactively looked for more information on requirements and domain knowledge, I also took more responsibility in the Topicals project, and adapted to challenges by focusing on the MVP. These improvements demonstrate my transition from an intermediate to an advanced developer.

### Long Answer

Improved communication and prioritization: I have actively participated in discussions about tasks, consistently prioritizing more important work. This demonstrates my ability to effectively communicate the status of my features and manage priorities efficiently.

Providing constructive feedback: I have been giving feedback to my co-worker, Sangita, which shows my commitment to collaborating with team members and contributing to their professional growth.

Proactive approach to requirements and domain knowledge: I have been proactively seeking more information about project requirements and domain knowledge in recent months. Learning from Isolocity, I now understand the importance of refining requirements before starting to work on a task.

Gaining deeper domain understanding: I have been researching the domain, creating documentation, and developing flowcharts to gain a better understanding of the bigger picture behind my tasks.

Taking responsibility for the Topicals project: I have taken on more responsibility in managing tasks for the Topicals project and partially carrying out the work that Giles would do, thereby making his life easier and demonstrating my ownership of the project.

Adapting to challenges and focusing on the MVP: I have encountered blocks due to lack of requirements or misunderstandings, which sometimes led to slowdowns in the timeline. However, I have learned to adapt by focusing on the MVP first and leaving the fancy stuff for later, showcasing my ability to adjust to unforeseen challenges.
