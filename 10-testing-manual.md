### Long Answer

I have taken ownership of the frontend project and worked closely with both frontend and backend developers to ensure seamless integration and an improved user experience. This shows my commitment to understanding the entire product and its requirements.

I have been more attentive to requirements and have been actively taking notes and clarifying any doubts to ensure that I thoroughly understand the expectations. This has allowed me to be more effective in my UX testing.
