### Long Answer

Improved communication with non-technical stakeholders: "I have been actively working on my communication skills, specifically when interacting with non-technical stakeholders. In my recent work with the QA team, I have had to describe QA Plans in a more non-technical language, which has helped me practice and refine my ability to simplify complex concepts."

Mentoring and supporting team members: "Over the past six months, I have been working closely with Sangita, teaching her how our system works and the steps needed to add features to the system. This experience has not only allowed me to share my knowledge but also to improve my communication skills when explaining technical concepts to others."

Contributing to technical documentation: "I have taken the initiative to add documentation to our codebase, ensuring that it is well-organized and accessible to the team. This has helped me practice explaining technical concepts in a clear and concise manner, which is essential for effective written communication."

Active participation in team discussions: "I have been actively involved in retrospectives, discussing potential technologies to address specific problems. While I recognize that there is room for improvement in explaining the main problem more clearly, these discussions have provided valuable opportunities for me to practice and refine my ability to communicate complex ideas to my peers."
