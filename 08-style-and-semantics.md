From `Intermediate` to `Advanced`

### Short Answer

I have significantly improved my code readability, clean code practices, and semantic understanding by focusing on details, leveraging TypeScript, reducing PR feedback, actively studying clean code principles, and enhancing overall code quality in my projects.

### Long Answer

I have been dedicating more attention to details, including choosing appropriate variable and function names. Additionally, I have been leveraging TypeScript to its full potential by creating helpful and complex types, which has contributed to improved code readability and semantic understanding.

My recent code reviews have shown a significant reduction in feedback related to variable names or typos. This demonstrates my progress in writing clean and readable code. I have also been proactive in adding useful comments, TypeScript documentation, and meaningful error messages or TODO comments to ensure my code is clear and easy to understand.

The reduced feedback in my PRs is a strong indicator of my progress in these areas.

I have been actively studying clean code principles and applying them to my work, which has contributed to my overall improvement as a developer.

While I may not have other specific achievements to highlight, my increased focus on code readability, clean code, and semantic understanding has had a positive impact on my work and the projects I've been involved in.
