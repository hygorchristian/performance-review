### Long Answer

I've been working on improving my testing skills by taking Kent Dodds' course on advanced testing techniques in JavaScript. It's been super helpful, and I've learned a lot of useful stuff.

In the last six months, I've been adding test cases and creating new test suites when needed. It shows that I'm getting better at understanding the importance of testing and how to put it into practice.

I've been trying to make our tests run faster by using Vitest. I want to bring the test run time down from 40 minutes to under 10 minutes. I've faced some challenges, but I'm not giving up â€“ I'll keep working on it until I find a solution.

I've gotten some nice feedback on my testing skills in recent pull requests. It's cool that my teammates have noticed the progress I've made.

I've been helping Sangita with increasing test coverage for our models and other parts of the code. It shows that I'm more confident in my testing skills and happy to share what I've learned with others.
