### Short Answer

In the past months, I have transitioned from an intermediate to an advanced developer by proactively addressing project requirements, refining my prioritization skills, enhancing communication with customers, and collaborating effectively with the QA team to improve product quality.

### Long Answer

In the past six months, I have taken ownership of projects and actively getting out more responsibilities to improve my skill set and contribute to the success of the company.

I recognized that the Topicals project was suffering from a lack of refined requirements and unclear flow. To address this, I proactively scheduled a meeting with the CEO to gain more insight, created a flow chart, and established a clear path for the MVP and subsequent releases.

I've developed a prioritization system to effectively manage my workload, focusing on support issues, QA issues, high priority tasks, unblocking co-workers, and then feature requests and small improvements.

I've been actively communicating with customers and implemented a significant improvement in the medical sales process, which has had a positive impact on our client base.

I contributed to the development of an interactive system for gathering requirements and domain knowledge, which ensures that the entire team is aligned and informed before writing stories or design documents.

I've collaborated with Jacob to address usability issues and implement small UI improvements, demonstrating my commitment to product quality and user experience.
